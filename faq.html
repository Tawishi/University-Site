        <button class="collapsible">What if I don’t have letter grades for some of my coursework or have chosen to take
            a class pass/fail?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At TU Admissions, we understand that there have been many disruptions over the past few years. Some of
                these may have impacted your grading systems. We want you to know that we accept whatever grades your
                school can make available to us and consider them in the context of your school, whether that be letter
                grades, numerical grades, narrative assessments, or something else.

                In some cases, you may have the ability to choose the type of grades you want to send us. Numerical or
                letter grades help us get a better understanding of your mastery in a subject. We encourage students to
                send those types of grades if they have them, because they help us make better decisions. Grades that
                are pass/fail give us confidence you have the minimum proficiency in a course to successfully pass.

                Please remember that no matter which type kind of grades you send, they are only one piece of the
                overall application. We look at other factors such as testing, what your teachers say, etc. in order to
                understand your academic preparation for TU. If there is an extenuating circumstance that has impacted
                your performance in a class, or a decision to take a course pass/fail instead of with a letter grade,
                you can use the additional information section on the self-reported coursework page to provide
                additional insight.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How can I explain the context of my grades/scores, and/or provide additional
            information?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On the application, there are designated spaces to provide additional context on how the pandemic or
                other circumstances may have disrupted your coursework, access to testing, and extracurricular
                activities. If you feel it would be helpful for us to know about your circumstances, you are welcome to
                use those spaces to share more.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What happens if I do not self-report an SAT or ACT score?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>If you have not already taken the SAT/ACT, and cannot find a forthcoming opportunity to do so safely, we
                will use other scores, grades, and additional information provided in the application. We encourage you
                to submit other testing that will help us understand your academic preparation. This may include any
                state examinations, AP, IB, AICE, (I)GCE, A-Levels, CAPE, WASSCE, KCSE, French Baccalaureate, or Abitur
                scores. Because we find the test scores to be predictive of student performance, we believe it is in
                your interest to submit scores if you have them.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How do I send in my transcript?</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>All transcripts must be submitted by a school counselor or another school representative to be considered
                official. This applies for high school and college transcripts. If your school does not have a school
                counselor, your transcript may be submitted by your registrar’s office, principal/headmaster, or other
                official entity.

                Our Transcripts page has more information on how to have your counselor submit your transcript.

        <button class="collapsible">How does TU use my test scores?
        </button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>TU uses a holistic admissions process, so test scores are just one factor among many for evaluating your
                preparedness for TU. Test scores are evaluated alongside other components of the application such as
                curriculum, grades, and other examinations. Test scores are not the single factor that determines an
                admission decision (there is no single factor), but they do help us better evaluate academic
                preparation. Because we find the test scores to be predictive of student performance, we believe it is
                in your best interest to submit scores if you have them.</p>
